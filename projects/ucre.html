                    consume, and collect digital content. Algorithms can often have biases that affect how users use and 
                    experience these platforms. These biases are most effectively monitored by the users. Through our 
                    research, we found that the current protocol that allows users to report and monitor algorithmic 
                    biases is ineffective. We aimed to design an easy-to-use interface that encourages users to

                  a separate ‘inbox’ where they can view all the reports they  made in the past. The progress bar shows the following 
                  stages: post submitted -> under review -> post evaluated -> final status. Through these features, users have 
                  increased transparency and control over the reporting process, thereby encouraging future participation in bias

                        Overall, I feel like our research methods reveals many valuable insights that helped us develop our
                      final prototype. Often, the findings from the various research methods were hard to synthesis but we
                    were able to collectively discuss them together and come up with ideas that seemed to align with our
                  main takeaways. If we were given more time, I would have liked to think deeper about how to create more value
                for users as well as the Instagram platform.</p>
